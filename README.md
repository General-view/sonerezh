# Sonerezh

Sonerezh is a self-hosted web application which allows you to listen to your
music, from anywhere.

All you have to do is to specify where your music is stored, and Sonerezh will
build its database based on the audio file's metadata. Then you can browse your
music library through a simple and intuitive Web UI.

Let's try the latest version on [sonerezh.bzh/demo]!

The documentation is available on [sonerezh.bzh].
