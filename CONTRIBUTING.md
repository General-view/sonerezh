# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this, because all the contributions to this
project are helpful.

If you haven't already, please open an issue. We will talk about your idea and
we want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

* [The official documentation]

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Sonerezh] with a clear list of what you've
done (read more about [pull requests]).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line message are fine for
small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragaph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding convention

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for
readability:

* We indent using four spaces (no tabs)
* As Sonerezh is built with CakePHP, we follow [their conventions]
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and
  make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love
  doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the
  ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
Guillaume and Thomas
